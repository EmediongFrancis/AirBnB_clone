# BaseModel Class


## Public instance attributes:
* `id`: string - assign with an uuid when an instance is created:
    * you can use uuid.uuid4() to generate unique id but don’t forget to convert to a string
    * the goal is to have unique id for each BaseModel
* `created_at`: datetime - assign with the current datetime when an instance is created
* `updated_at`: datetime - assign with the current datetime when an instance is created and it will be updated every time you change your object
* `__str__`: should print: `[<class name>] (<self.id>) <self.__dict__>`

## Public instance methods:
* `save(self)`: updates the public instance attribute updated_at with the current datetime
* `to_dict(self)`: returns a dictionary containing all keys/values of __dict__ of the instance:
by using `self.__dict__`, only instance attributes set will be returned
a key `__class__` must be added to this dictionary with the class name of the object
* `created_at` and `updated_at` must be converted to string object in ISO format:
format: `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f (ex: 2017-06-14T22:31:03.285259)`
* you can use `isoformat()` of datetime object

This method will be the first piece of the serialization/deserialization process: create a dictionary representation with “simple object type” of our BaseModel.
