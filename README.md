## First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

 ### Each task is linked and will help you to:

* put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
* create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
* create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
* create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
* create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine


## What’s a command interpreter?
Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* How to create a Python package
* How to create a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module
* What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
* How to serialize and deserialize a Class
* How to write and read a JSON file
* How to manage datetime
* What is an UUID
* What is *args and how to use it
* What is **kwargs and how to use it
* How to handle named arguments in a function
